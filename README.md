SRB2Terminal
============

A netplay enhancement mod for SRB2. See http://mb.srb2.org/showthread.php?t=39392

This is considered the "working branch" of Terminal, and may contain errors. Use this version at your own risk. The latest stable version will always be available in the MB release thread, and is the recommended version to use or base changes on.


Instructions
============

1. Extract Terminal files to your SRB2 folder
2. Rename <code>term_logins.ex.txt</code> to <code>term_logins.txt</code> if you want to use the login module
3. Host the server
4. <code>exec loadall.txt</code> in the console, or manually load whichever modules you want (make sure to load <code>Terminal_Core.lua</code> first)
5. DEDICATED SERVERS ONLY: Execute the <code>iamtheserver</code> command in the console. 

If you find any issues with hosting, make sure to tell us about them. After Terminal is up and running, you can use <code>term_help</code> in the console to bring up a help dialog that will cover basic use of the mod.
