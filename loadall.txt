// Feel free to edit this script as needed. This is a convenience, that you can run to quickly load all of Terminal at once.

addfile Terminal_Core.lua	// The core script. DON'T REMOVE (the other scripts use functions defined here!)

addfile Terminal_Voting.lua	// The voting module. Allows votekick and other similar things.

addfile Terminal_Cheats.lua	// Cheats module. Allows players with cheat permissions to execute certain cheats. If not added, cheat permissions can still be given, though!

addfile Terminal_Login.lua // Login module. Allows players to register accounts and log into them afterwards. Accounts carry permissions with them.
